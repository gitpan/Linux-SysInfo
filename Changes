        + Add : Kwalitee test.
	+ Chg : Makefile.PL overhaul.
        + Chg : Hash keys are now shared. This new implementation doesn't like
                5.9.3, but seems to be somehow ok with 5.9.5. If you're using
                5.9.3, either upgrade or keep with the precedent module version.
