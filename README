NAME
    Linux::SysInfo - Perl interface to the sysinfo(2) Linux system call.

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
        use Linux::SysInfo qw/sysinfo/;

        my $si = sysinfo;
        print "$_: $si->{$_}\n" for keys %$si;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a wrapper around the sysinfo(2) Linux system call. It
    gives information about the current uptime, load average, memory usage
    and processes running. Other systems have also this system call (e.g.
    Solaris), but in most cases the returned information is different.

EXPORT
    The only function of this module, "sysinfo", and the constant
    "LS_HAS_EXTENDED" are only exported on request.

FUNCTIONS
  "sysinfo"
    This function takes no argument. It returns undef on failure or a hash
    reference whose keys are the members name of the struct sysinfo on
    success :

    "uptime"
        Seconds elapsed since the system booted.

    "load1", "load5", "load15"
        1, 5 and 15 minutes load average.

    "totalram"
        Total usable main memory size.

    "freeram"
        Available memory size.

    "sharedram"
        Amount of shared memory.

    "bufferram"
        Memory used by buffers.

    "totalswap"
        Total swap space size.

    "freeswap"
        Swap space stil available.

    "procs"
        Number of current processes.

    Prior to Linux 2.3.23 on i386 and 2.3.48 on all other architectures, the
    memory sizes were given in bytes. Since then, the following members are
    also available and all the memory sizes are given as multiples of
    mem_unit bytes :

    "totalhigh"
        Total high memory size.

    "freehigh"
        Available high memory size.

    "mem_unit"
        Memory unit size in bytes.

CONSTANTS
  LS_HAS_EXTENDED
    This constant is set to 1 if your kernel supports the three extended
    fields "totalhigh", "freehigh" and "mem_unit" ; and to 0 otherwise.

BINARY COMPATIBILITY
    If you upgrade your kernel to a greater version than 2.3.23 on i386 or
    2.3.48 on any other platform, you will need to rebuild the module to
    access the extended fields.

    Moreover, since the perl hash function has changed after the 5.6
    version, you will also need to recompile the module if you upgrade your
    perl from a version earlier than 5.6.
